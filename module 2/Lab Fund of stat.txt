Challenge 1
One player rolls two dices. Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:

A. The values that the player obtains.
Random values from 1 to 6 for each dices

C. The maximum value obtained after rolling both dices. 12
Describe the following events:

Case A: Both values are greater than 5.
both values are 6. Sum 12.
Case B: The sum of values is even. it means that we will get a int when we devide it by 2. It means that either two values were even or both of them were odd.

Challenge 2
One player picks two cards from a poker deck. Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:

A. The number of figures he picks. measurable space : 0,1 et 2
Prob = 12/52*11/51

Probalité = (13+13)/52 = 0,52

Describe the following events:

Case A: The number of figures in the cards the player picked is two.

event
Case B: The sum of card values is 17.

6 options *16 combinations = 96 overall combinations
probability is 96/(52*51)= 4%

Case C: The value of both cards is less than 8.
somme possible : 6 possibilities for each of them (6*4)/52* (6*4-1)/(51)= 21%

Challenge 3
Two players roll a dice. Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:

A. The score of player A. omega de 1 à 6

B. The greatest score. 6 - 6
MS (2_6). Max 6_6
C. The earnings of player A if the game rules state that:
"The player with the greatest score gets a coin from the other player.".
Probab 50%
D. The earnings of player A if the game rules state that:
"The player with the greatest score gets as many coins as the difference between the score of player A and player B.".
50%*(delta). gains : 1 à 5 coins

Describe the following events:

Case A: The score of player A is 2.
P  =1/6

Case B: The greatest score is lower or equal than 2.
1/6*1/6 *2 = 1/18
Case C: Considering the case where the winner gets as many coins as the difference between scores (D), describe:
Player A wins at least 4 coins. 2/36 = 1/18 (1 - 5 ou 2-6)
Player A loses more than 2 coins.
1 - 4,5,6
2 - 5,6
3 - 6
6 /36 = 1/6 (probabilité)
Player A neither wins nor loses coins. 6/36 = 1/6
Bonus challenges
Bonus Challenge 1
Three players take balls from a box. Inside that box there are red, blue, green and black balls. The players can take three balls at mosts with the following rules:

If the ball is blue, they can take another ball.
If the ball is green, they get one point and they can take another ball.
If the ball is red, they can’t take another ball.
If the ball is black, they lose one point and they can’t take another ball.
Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:

A. Player A wins. Do not consider ties as a win.
B. Player A and B get the same points.
C. All players get 0 points.
Bonus Challenge 2

Bonus Challenge 3
One player takes three balls from a box. Inside the box there are 5 balls: two of them are black and the other three are white.

Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:

A. The number of white balls if every time we take a ball we keep it.
B. The number of white balls if every time we take a ball we put it back again into the box.
C. The number of black balls if every time we take a ball we keep it.
D. The number of black balls if every time we take a ball we put it back into the box.
